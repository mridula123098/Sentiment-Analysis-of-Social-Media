# Social Media Sentiment & Trend Analysis

### Project Overview:
This project analyzes social media (X/Twitter) data to understand audience sentiment and brand perception. 
It demonstrates end-to-end NLP and machine learning workflow for extracting actionable insights that can guide media strategy and engagement optimization.

### Key Features:
1. Collects and preprocesses social media text data.
2. Performs sentiment analysis using Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
3. Provides brand-wise sentiment and engagement trends.
4. Offers insights for content strategy, audience engagement, and media monitoring.

### Tools Used:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn),
2. NLP Techniques (Tokenization, Stopwords removal, Stemming, TF-IDF vectorization)
3. ML Models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)

### Project Workflow:
1. Data Collection: Gathered tweets/posts using API or dataset.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removed noise, stopwords, performed stemming, tokenization.
3. Feature Engineering: Converted text to numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
4. Model Building: Trained and evaluated ML models for sentiment classification.
5. Analysis: Brand-wise sentiment distribution, trend identification, actionable insights.
6. Visualization: Plotted sentiment trends and engagement metrics.

### Results:
1. Achieved reliable sentiment classification with model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
2. Identified brands with highest positive/negative engagement.
3. Provided actionable recommendations for content strategy and audience targeting.
